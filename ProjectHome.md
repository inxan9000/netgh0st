**NetGh0st**  

Netgh0st is a captive application written in Perl5. The project started out as a way to quickly run as many service/network/system ennumeration utilities as possible, while creating a log. During a professional pentest, this would be useful (but noisy) to break a WEP/WPA key, authenticate to the network, and run this tool.

Later the project got a bit more advanced, becoming captive from a shell script, relying less on dependencies, and more.

Finally the final version 3 - has not a single dependency, being all coded in Perl and using Perl modules. New support for MAC vendor lookups was added and a few more things.
